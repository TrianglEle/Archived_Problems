Hazel:
starts in her room, attached to her BiPAP in her PJs

	if they try to leave the bed just simply, give sudden warning saying that her BiPAP was pulled

	if they remove BiPAP or give any other cancer specific command, then comply

	if they decide to stay in and use phone, enter phone

		in phone, give chat option, call option, checking calender or just playing some tunes

after any of there options, enter mother. gives a little cheer asking if you know what day it is?(correct answer is world theatre day)

	if they answer right, patt on the back and tell about the day plans after support group. watching America's Next Top Model

		if she starts to argue, parents be assertive

		if she agrees, then cool


Augustus:
starts at his basement, drooling on his console's controller. Slept playing Price of Dawn

	if they try to walk out without mentioning picking up fake leg, stumble and fall down

	if they decide to continue playing the game, enter last save, next to a church in which there are hostages, and terrorists outside the premis with assault rifles
	
		if they decide to jump at the front door to let the hostages escape (they probably will if they are aware of TFITS) then let them and blow up the game

		if they get some grenades and try to kill the hostages, then win game (technically minigame, or inceptionised game)

	if they decide to stay in and use phone, enter phone

		in phone, give chat option, call option, checking calender or just playing some tunes


Isaac:
starts at a mall with Monica, at the pizza store

half blind currently, alwaysing a little, and heading towards the support group. story mainly starts at support group.

Patrick asks him to speak. he says that he's got eye cancer, kinda sucks. but doesn't suck that bad cause he has a super hot girlfriend Monica and friends like Augustus who help and support him all the time.

	after support group
		if they wanna go to Monica, do that

		if they wanna go with Augustus to play some Price of Dawn, do that

		if they wanna go home and do some school work, do that
